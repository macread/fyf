I would begin by looking at the functionality from the user standpoint and extract the simular functions. 
Then I would look at the code itself, because appearences can be deceiving. There are some obvious places,
like user login, user preferences and related information.

What technologies? I tend towards open source where ever possible. Front end work would mostly use javascript,
React, Redux or Mobx for state management. Back end would be Node.js. The database would be a combination of 
NOSQL and SQL. I would also look at implementing micro services so the technology can be easily swapped out
to better suit the company's needs.
